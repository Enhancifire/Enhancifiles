const pieceTreeTextBufferBuilder = new PieceTreeTextBufferBuilder();
pieceTreeTextBufferBuilder.acceptChunk('abc\n');
pieceTreeTextBufferBuilder.acceptChunk('def');
const pieceTreeFactory = pieceTreeTextBufferBuilder.finish(true);
const pieceTree = pieceTreeFactory.create(DefaultEndOfLine.LF);

pieceTree.getLineCount(); // 2
pieceTree.getLineContent(1); // 'abc'
pieceTree.getLineContent(2); // 'def'

pieceTree.insert(1, '+');
pieceTree.getLineCount(); // 2
pieceTree.getLineContent(1); // 'a+bc'
