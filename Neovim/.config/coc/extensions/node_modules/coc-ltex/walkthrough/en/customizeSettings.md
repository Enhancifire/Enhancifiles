# Customize Settings

LT<sub>E</sub>X features lots of settings, which can be used to customize the checking experience.

Click on the *Open LTeX settings* button to open the settings of LT<sub>E</sub>X. You can do that manually by running the command *Preferences: Open Settings (UI)* in the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and selecting *Extensions* &#x203a; *LTeX* on the left side.

Some settings are:

- [`ltex.language`](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/settings.html#ltexlanguage) sets the language in which the documents are checked. The default language is English.
- [`ltex.latex.commands`](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/settings.html#ltexlatexcommands) allows ignoring custom L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X commands.
- There are many more settings. [Check the extensive documentation for detailed descriptions.](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/settings.html)
