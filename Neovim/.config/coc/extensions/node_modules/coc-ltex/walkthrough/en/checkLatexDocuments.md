# Check L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X Documents

To check documents in a code language like L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X that is not supported by VS Code out-of-the-box, you have to install an extension that provides VS Code support for that language.

For example, to check L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X documents, install the *LaTeX Workshop* extension by clicking on the *Install LaTeX Workshop Extension* button.

After you have installed *LaTeX Workshop,* click on the button *Open LaTeX Example* to open the following example document in a new editor. LT<sub>E</sub>X will underline two errors after a short period of time.

```latex
\section{\LaTeX{} Example}

This is a sentence \emph{without any errors.}
This is a sentence \emph{with a speling error.}
Finally, this is a sentence \emph{with an grammar error.}
```
