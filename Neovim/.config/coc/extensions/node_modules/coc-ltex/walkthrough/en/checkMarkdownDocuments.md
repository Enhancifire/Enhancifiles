# Check Markdown Documents

Checking Markdown documents is easy with LT<sub>E</sub>X. Just open them, and LT<sub>E</sub>X will underline spelling and grammar errors, if there are any.

If you open a new untitled file, change the language mode to `markdown` by running the command *Change Language Mode* in the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

When started for the first time, LT<sub>E</sub>X downloads necessary components to the extension folder. [Read the documentation for offline installation methods.](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/vscode-ltex/installation-usage-vscode-ltex.html#offline-installation)

Click on the button *Open Markdown Example* to open the following example document in a new editor. LT<sub>E</sub>X will underline two errors after a short period of time.

```markdown
# Markdown Example

This is a sentence *without any errors.*
This is a sentence *with a speling error.*
Finally, this is a sentence *with an grammar error.*
```
